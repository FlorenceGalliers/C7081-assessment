# Background:
House prices are an important part of the economy and usually reflect trends in it. They can be influenced by the physical condition of the house and by other attributes such as location [@bin2004prediction]. Prices are important for homeowners, prospective buyers and estate agents, prediction methods could help lead to more informed decisions to each of these stakeholders. @gao2019location suggest that prediction models may be useful for a few reasons, firstly in narrowing down the range of available houses for prospective buyers. People looking to put their house on the market could use prediction models to look for the optimal time to do so. Prediction accuracy is important.

In most countries there is some form of house price index that measures changes in prices [@lu2017hybrid]. This contains a summary of all transactions that take place but not the individual features of each house sold, therefore it cannot be used to make predictions of house price.

Something else to take into account is that it may be difficult for prospective buyers to visualise how square footage measurements of a house are calculated or how this measurement translates into physical size if they have not visited the house themselves. Buyers therefore rely on factors such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms or house age to get an idea of the value of the house. This analysis will focus on which features of a house have the largest influence on the prediction of house prices. This report does not look at the effect of time on house prices. It is already a well known fact that house prices increase every year [@alfiyatin2017modeling]. 

Many house price prediction models have been created using machine learning methods. The hedonic price model is the most extensively researched and uses regression methods [@gao2019location]. Machine learning methods use data in a ‘training set’ to build a model, this model is then used to make predictions on an unseen ‘test set’ of data. The accuracy of models can be calculated by taking the predicted values from the actual values.

## Objectives:
* Understand which attributes of houses given in the data set can be used to effectively construct a prediction model for house price (dependent variable).
* Minimize the differences between predicted and actual house prices by using model selection to choose the most accurate model.

# Data:

## Data Description
The dataset chosen for this analysis is from houses sold in 2014 in Washington, USA. It contains the sale price (US dollars) along with attributes of each house such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc. There were 4600 observations with 17 variables in the original data set downloaded from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/shree1992/housedata).
Although the dataset is from 2014, it was a particularly interesting data set because it contains a large amount of information and interesting selection of variables. A more recent data set, or one from the UK could not be found, and so this analysis will go ahead with this data set.

## Data Preparation
The first task was preparing and cleaning the dataset. This served two purposes, firstly to get to know the different variables in the data and existing patterns or correlations between them and secondly to carry out feature selection. Missing values were searched for and removed and any observations in which price equalled zero were removed. The cleaned dataset was exported ready for use in the main analysis. This cleaned data set contained 4522 observations and 12 variables (Table 1).

```{r, Table 1, echo = FALSE}

#insert table 1
# data_descriptions <- c("House sale price in thousands of US dollars", 
      #                 "Number of bedrooms",
       #                "Number of bathrooms",
        #               "Area of whole housing lot in square feet",
         #              "Number of floors in the house",
          #               "Area of house in square feet",
            #           "Condition of house, 1 to 5",
             #          "1 = if house has a basement, 0 = no basement",
              #         "Year that the house was built subtracted from 2014",
               #        "1 = if house has been renovated, 0 = if no renovation",
                #       "Location of house to the nearest city in Washington, USA",
                 #      "Zip code of house")

# data_dictionary <- data.frame(names(data), data_descriptions)

# kable(data_dictionary,
    #  col.names = c("Variable", "Description"),
    #  caption = "Data Dictionary")

```


# Methods
House price is a continuous variable and so a supervised learning approach was chosen throughout. The dataset was split randomly into two parts, a training set containing 80% of the observations and a test set containing the remaining 20%. The training set will be used to train all of the models and the test set will be used to assess accuracy of the models. 

```{r, splitting into training and test set, include = FALSE}
set.seed(2) # set seed
n <- nrow(data) # create variable with number of rows
train_index <- sample(1:n, size = round(0.8*n), replace=FALSE) 
train <- data[train_index ,] # takes 80% of the data for training set
test <- data[-train_index ,] # remaining 20% for the test set

dummy_data <- dummy.data.frame(data, sep = ".")
names(dummy_data)

dummy_train <- dummy.data.frame(train, sep = ".")
names(dummy_train)

dummy_test <- dummy.data.frame(test, sep = ".")
names(dummy_test)
```
 
## Linear Regression
To begin, a simple linear regression model was created using price as the dependent variable and square foot living area (sqft_living) as the independent variable. Sqft_living was chosen because it was shown to be the most correlated variable to house price in the exploratory data analysis. A simple linear regression model uses the *lm* function. Linear regression fits a line of best fit which minimises the difference between predicted and actual values.
 
```{r, Simple lm, include = FALSE}
# create simple linear model using price as dependent variable and sqft_living
# as independent variable, and training data set
simple_lm <- lm(price ~ sqft_living, 
               data = train)
# make predictions using this model on test data set
simple_pred <- predict(simple_lm, 
                       test) 
# calculate MSE of simple linear model
simple_lm_MSE <- mean((test[, "price"] - simple_pred)^2)
# calculate RMSE
simple_lm_RMSE <- sqrt(simple_lm_MSE)

# print summary of model
summary(simple_lm)
```

To see what effect other variables had on this, multiple linear regression was then carried out using all of the other variables available.

```{r, Multiple lm, include = FALSE}
# create a multiple linear model using price as dependent variable and all
# other variables, training data set
multiple_lm <- lm(price ~ .,
                  data = train)
# make predictions using this model on test data set
multiple_pred <- predict(multiple_lm,
                       test)
# calculate MSE of multiple linear model
multiple_lm_MSE <- mean((test[, "price"] - multiple_pred)^2)
# calculate RMSE of multiple linear model
multiple_lm_RMSE <- sqrt(multiple_lm_MSE)

# print summary of model
summary(multiple_lm)

```

It became apparent that sqft_living variable and the multiple linear regression models yielded different RMSE values, suggesting that some of the other variables in addition to sqft_lviing must be contributing to the prediction of price. 
 
## Variable Selection
To look into this further and decide which variables were most influential on price, variable selection methods were explored. Best subset selection, forward selection and backwards selection were all tried. Best subset selection is a method that finds the best combinations of predictors that produce the best fit in terms of squared error. Forward selection is slightly different as it starts with no variables and one by one adds the variable which gives the smallest increase in squared error. Backward selection follows the same idea as forward selection but it starts with a full model, and iteratively removes variables until it leaves a one variable model with the lowest mean squared error. 

Using cross-validation in best subset selection, a model with 15 variables was shown have the lowest cross-validation error. These variables were extracted and a linear model created containing only them. This linear model had a lower RMSE than either of the simple or multiple linear models tried above. It was decided that going forward, these variables would be the ones used to trial other methods.

Forward and backward selection yielded almost idential results to each other with only a one variable difference to best-subset selection, so the variables chosen using best-subset selection were the ones used.

```{r, Variable Selection, include = FALSE}
# Fit subset selection model
bestsub <- regsubsets(price ~ .,
                      data = train,
                      nvmax = 44)

summary(bestsub)

# Create test matrix

                            data = test)

# Create loop for finding validation errors for a model of each size

for(i in 1:44) {
  coefi <- coef(bestsub, id = i)
  pred <- test_matrix[ ,names(coefi)]%*%coefi
  val_errors[i] = mean((test$price - pred)^2)
}

## Ridge Regression and LASSO
Ridge Regression and the LASSO are both shrinkage methods. 
 
Ridge Regression utilises L2 regularisation, this adds a penalty to the coefficients that is equal to the square of the coefficients.

```{r, ridge regression, include = FALSE}
# Fit a ridge regression, choose lambda by cross validation
set.seed(1)
# Split train and test data into x and y 
x_train <- model.matrix(price ~ ., data = best_train)[,-1]
x_test <- model.matrix(price ~ ., data = best_test)[,-1]
y_train <- best_train$price
y_test <- best_test$price
# Finding optimal value of lambda using cross validation
cv.ridge <- cv.glmnet(x_train, 
                      y_train, 
                      alpha = 0)
# Assign it to best.lambda variable
best.lambda <- cv.ridge$lambda.min
best.lambda
plot(cv.ridge) 
# Report test error of ridge regression 
ridge.mod <- glmnet(x_train, y_train, alpha = 0)
ridge.pred <- predict(ridge.mod, 
                      s = best.lambda,
                      newx = x_test)
ridge_MSE <- mean((ridge.pred - y_test)^2) 
ridge_RMSE <- sqrt(39347.87) 
```

LASSO is another coefficient shrinkage technique in which the L0 norm is replaced with the L1 norm. This applies a penalty to the coefficients equal to the absolute value of the coefficients. In LASSO methods, lambda the tuning parameter allows some coefficients to be set equal to 0, in which case they are dropped out of the regression model. In this way it also acts as a selection method for choosing the variables with the most influence. We can change lambda to any value, but in this analysis cross-validation was used to select the best value of lambda.
 
```{r, LASSO, include = FALSE}
lasso.mod <- glmnet(x_train, 
                    y_train, 
                    alpha = 1)
plot(lasso.mod, 
     xvar='lambda')

set.seed(1)
cv.lasso <- cv.glmnet(x_train, 
                      y_train,
                      alpha = 1)
plot(cv.lasso)
best.lamb <- cv.lasso$lambda.min
lasso.pred <- predict(lasso.mod, s = best.lamb, 
                      newx = x_test)

# Report test error and number of non zero coefficients for LASSO
lasso_MSE <- mean((lasso.pred - y_test)^2)
lasso_RMSE <- sqrt(38701.11)

out <- glmnet(x_train, y_train, alpha = 1)
lasso.coef <- predict(out, type = "coefficients", 
                      s = best.lamb)
lasso.coef
lasso.coef[lasso.coef!=0]
```
 
 
## Tree Based Methods
Multiple tree based methods were explored in this analysis, starting with one simple decision tree, moving through randomForests, bagging and boosting.
 
Using just one decision tree gave a RMSE higher than using just ordinary least squares.

```{r, Simple decision tree, include = FALSE}
tree_house <- tree(price ~ ., 
                   data = best_train)

summary(tree_house)

plot(tree_house) 
text(tree_house, pretty = 0, cex = 0.8)

# Tree indicates that sqft_living is the most important variable
cv_tree <- cv.tree(tree_house)
plot(cv_tree$size, cv_tree$dev, type = "b")

prunedtree <- prune.tree(tree_house, best = 5)
plot(prunedtree)
text(prunedtree, pretty = 0)

# The pruned tree and the unpruned tree have the same 
# cross validation error so we can use either to make predictions

yhat <- predict(prunedtree, newdata = best_test)
testdata <- best_test[ ,"price"]
plot(yhat, testdata)
abline(0, 1)

tree_MSE <- mean((yhat-testdata)^2)
tree_RMSE <- sqrt(MSE_tree)
```

### Random Forests 
RandomForest is a method that combines together multiple decision trees.

```{r, randomForest, include = FALSE}

```

### Bagging
Bagging stands for bootstrap aggregation. This method uses multiple decision trees (the ‘aggregation’ part) that are each trained with different data samples, with replacement (the ‘bootstrap’ part)

```{r, Bagging, include = FALSE}

```


### Boosting
Boosting

```{r, Boosting, include = FALSE}

```
