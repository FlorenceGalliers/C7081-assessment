Statistical Analysis for Data Science Assessment

This repository is part of my C7081 Assignment in which I undertook a statistical analysis on a data set.

##Can we predict house prices using known features of each house and a supervised learning approach?

It contains the following files:

**1.0-EDA.R** is the R script for my exploratory data analysis, using the **original-data.csv** and outputting **cleaned-data.xlsx** for use in the **2.0-Methods.R** script. **results.xlsx** is a file created during the methods which outputs part of the results table shown in the Report.

**3.0-Report.Rmd** is the RMarkdown document used to create my **3.0-Report.pdf** document that was required for submission. **20350200-Report.pdf** is just a downloaded version of this. 

All plots seen in the report are contained within the 'Plots' folder.

Other files are my-header.tex and ref.bib, there are the set up files and document containing my references for the report.
