This repository is part of my C7081 Assignment in which I undertook a statistical analysis on a data set.

Can we predict house prices using known features of each house and a supervised learning approach?

It contains the following files:

[1.0-EDA](1.0-EDA.R) is the R script for my exploratory data analysis, using the [original data](original-data.csv) downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shree1992/housedata)and outputting a [cleaned dataset](cleaned-data.xlsx) for use in the [Methods](2.0-Methods.R) script. [results.xlsx](results.xlsx) is a file created during the methods which outputs part of the results table shown in the Report.

[3.0-Report](3.0-Report.Rmd) is the RMarkdown document used to create my final report(3.0-Report.pdf) document that was required for submission. [20350200-Report](20350200-Report.pdf) is the same as this. 

All plots seen in the report are contained within the 'Plots' folder.

Other files are my-header.tex and ref.bib, there are the set up files and document containing my references for the report.
